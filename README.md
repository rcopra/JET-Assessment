## Restaurant Search - A short project for the JET Early Careers Interview process

The goal of this project is to find restaurant data from an endpoint and to filter this data.

Per the assigment instructions, we're only concerned with the following pieces of data from the endpoints response:

- Name
- Cuisines
- Rating - as a number
- Address

I chose to build this project using Javascript and HTML. I'm more experienced in Ruby on Rails and I initially wanted to use Rails to build the app accordingly, but felt that using a more popular framework that felt more appopriate for the assigment at hand was more practical.
